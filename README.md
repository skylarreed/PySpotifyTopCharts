Hello, this is my little project I have been working on that takes the billboard top charts from a selected year, and 
creates a playlist for you. So far the code works great, but there can be a couple 404s thrown every now in then. 
This is due to the Spotify API, so I suggest just rerunning the code. I look forward to adding a simple gui in the future,
but for know it is just CLI. Enjoy!
